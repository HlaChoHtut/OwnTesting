            Mogok (<a href="#">Burmese</a>: မိုးကုတ်မြို့; MLCTS: mui: kut mrui., [móɡoʊʔ]; Shan: မိူင်းၵုတ်ႈ, [mɤ́ŋ kut]) is a city in the Pyin Oo Lwin District of Mandalay Division of Myanmar, located 200 kilometers (120 mi) north of Mandalay and 148 kilometers (92 mi) north-east of Shwebo.

            Mogok is believed to have been founded in 1217 by three lost Shan hunters who discovered rubies at the base of a collapsed mountain.<sup>[2]</sup>  According to the tale, the hunters returned to their home in Momeik and offered the precious stones to the local saopha who established a village in what would become modern-day Mogok.<sup>[2]</sup> 
            Following the 1885 Third Anglo-Burmese War in which the British conquered and annexed the hitherto independent Upper Burma, in 1886 the British launched a military expedition to "open up" the ruby mines at Mogok and make them available to British merchants. George Skelton Streeter, a gem expert and son of Edmund Streeter of the Streeters & Co Ltd jewelry company in London, accompanied the expedition and stayed there to work as a government valuer in the British-run mines.<sup>[3]</sup> 
            In 2018, the Mogok commemorated the 800th anniversary of the city's founding. <sup>[4]</sup>
